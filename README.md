# HEIC Converter App

[HEIC](http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/iphone/what-is-heic-3660408/) is a growing image format that is quickly gaining popularity. It is the primary for new iPhones and iPads, and is being introduced in new [DLSR cameras](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/explore/product-showcases/cameras-and-lenses/1dx-mark-iii) as well. Having been an Apple exclusive for a few years, tooling around using and converting the format has been limited to just Apple devices.

Well, that is no more. Using the [HEIC Converter](https://catdad-experiments.github.io/heic-app/), you can now convert your images anywhere you use the browser -- works across any phone, laptop, or desktop, across Windows, Linux, and MacOS. And best of all, you don't need to install anything. It just works directly in your browser.

If you do wish to install it, just follow the prompt to install the app, or create a shortcut through your browser's menu.
